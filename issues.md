## Questions/Decisions Needed ðŸ¤”

### Decision Log

**Decision 1: MCP vs Direct APIs**
- **Question:** Use MCP servers or direct API calls for external tools?
- **Decision:** Direct APIs
- **Rationale:** 
  - Time constraint (4.5 hours)
  - Already have API documentation
  - Easier debugging during demo
  - Autonomy judging based on logic, not transport layer
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Date:** 2025-10-04

**Decision 2: Deployment Strategy**
- **Question:** Local + ngrok vs cloud deployment?
- **Decision:** Start with local + ngrok, structure for easy cloud migration
- **Rationale:**
  - Faster iteration during development
  - Can switch to cloud if needed
  - Docker + env vars make migration simple
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Date:** 2025-10-04

## Known Limitations

### MVP Scope
- Learning engine may be simplified (rule-based vs ML)
- Some external APIs may be mocked if rate limits hit
- UI will be minimal but functional

### Technical Debt
- Error handling can be improved post-hackathon
- Testing coverage minimal (focus on core logic)
- No authentication layer (demo purposes)

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)

- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Implement proper ML model for learning
- [ ] Add more medical conditions to knowledge base
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket alerts
- [ ] Mobile app
- [ ] Integration with actual health data sources (Fitbit, Apple Health)
- [ ] Multi-language support beyond DeepL
- [ ] Advanced FHIR resource parsing
